# MiPlanta - Capstone Project

## Description
miPlanta is a mobile-first marketplace designed to connect plant enthusiasts and sellers. Users can browse and post listings for plants, view detailed information about plants for sale, and manage their profiles, including their own listings.

## Setup

### Client Side
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ZuriGomez/zuri-gomez-miplanta.git`
2. Navigate to the client directory: `cd zuri-gomez-miplanta`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Create a `.env` file in the root of the client directory and add the following:
5. Start the client: `npm run dev`
6. Access the app at: `http://localhost:5173`

## Testing the App
You can test the app by signing up or logging in with your own information, as long as it meets the validation requirements for the inputs.

For a full interactive experience, you can log in using the following credentials:
- **Email:** `lily.goodwill@example.com`
- **Password:** `password2024`

## Notes
- Ensure that both the client and server (zuri-gomez-miplanta-api) are running simultaneously for the app to function.
- You need MySQL installed and a database named `miplanta` configured with the credentials provided in the `.env` file in the server side (zuri-gomez-miplanta-api).

## Future Enhancements
This project is the first iteration of MiPlanta. Future updates will include features like messaging, advanced filters, and geolocation-based suggestions.

Happy planting! ðŸŒ±
